# Alternative Language Project

### Author: Cheryl Moser

## Programming language and version: Kotlin v1.9.0

I chose this programming language because I am a fan of Android. If I was going
to work in mobile development, I'd like to develop for Android.

## Language features

* object-oriented programming
* file ingestion
* conditional statements
* assignment statements
* loops
* subprograms (functions/methods)
* unit testing and exception handling

## Libraries used (up to 3, if any)

List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and
explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

## Answer the following questions

#### What company (oem) has the highest average weight of the phone body?

#### Was there any phones that were announced in one year and released in another? What are they? Give me the oem and models.

#### How many phones have only one feature sensor?

#### What year had the most phones launched in any year later than 1999?
